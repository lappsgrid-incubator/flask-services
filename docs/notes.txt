SUB TABS

When it comes to printing the sub tabs, we should be sensitive that we want to
group some of them, for example, PhraseStructure and Constituent should be in
the same tab (maybe just called PhraseStructure).

Same holds for DependencyStructure and Dependency.

And maybe we should also group Token/Token#pos and Sentence so we have the
one-sentence-per-line and space-separated-tokens visualization.


VISUALIZATIONS

Token
   space-separated

Sentence
   one-sentence-per-line

Token and Sentence
   space-separated
   one-sentence-per-line

NamedEntity
   text with entities highlighted
   entity type as superscript after last token
   highlight every token in an entity individually
   	     (avoiding crossing tags)

PhraseStructure
   assumes Constituent
   print one-sentence-per-line
   each sentence has icon for visualization
   clicking icon gives a graphviz or spaCy visualization
      for that sentence
